# Cats Vs Dogs
##Description
    This is an slightly altered tutorial from tensorflow websites. This algorithm
    predicts if the uploaded image is an cat dog or neither. This python project
    takes a picture from the images directory and tests it against the model. The
    model has been tested on many pictures but only 4 can be found in folder to 
    save space

##Requirements
    Please install an virtual enviroment as tensorflow does not currently support
    the latest version of python. Also refer to step 1 in how to make your own 
    to get other requirements for running the program

#How to make your own

##Step 1:
    Get a google colabs account and run the code there if you dont have enough
    ram. Tensorflow needs tons of ram to run or a Nividia GPU. If you choose 
    to run it on your desktop install an virtual enviroment. Inside the 
    virtual enviroment install tensorflow, mathplotlib,opencv and numpy, note
    that it is best to run on python 3.7 if you are running only main2 as python
    and tensorflow versions may create a problem with current model created

##Step 2:
    visit the tensorflow website and look at tutorial on how to create models
    
##Step 3:
    If you want to create the model and train it on your desktop as well make
    sure you have all the requirements. This model that main two uses is only
    87% accurate and was not trained as much. You can change the steps and 
    ephocs to increase accuracy but not it may only be very accurate for the 
    test data and not all data
